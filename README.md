**due to css modifications (i'm still working on it) the css file that has the newest features might be one of these 2 links:**

* link: https://rawgit.com/Brotat0/dubtrack_css/master/CSS_dubtrack.css
* link: https://rawgit.com/Brotat0/dubtrack_css/master/CSS-dubtrack.css

Although, that does not mean that the other link will not work. Both links might work aswell. 

Feel free to fork
